Notes on adding tensorflow lite to an existing project

Starting with a working Nordic project, bsp, from SDK 17.0.2, using Segger SES 7.10a.
Target is PCA10056
Get RTT working
	Disabled retarget
	Enabled RTT (RTT_ENABLED = 1)
	Exculded segger file from build

Plan is to put tensor flow "main" stuff into a separate top level file called TFLite_Top.cpp
Added a pointer to model
Added some include tflite folders
Changed c++ type to c++11 (in SES project build options)
