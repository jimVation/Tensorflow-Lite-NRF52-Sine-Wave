Notes on adding tensorflow lite to an existing project

Starting with a working Nordic project, bsp, from SDK 17.0.2, using Segger SES 7.10a.
Target is PCA10056
Get RTT working
	Disabled retarget
	Enabled RTT (RTT_ENABLED = 1)
	Exculded segger file from build

Plan is to put tensor flow "main" stuff into a separate top level file called TFLite_Top.cpp
Added a pointer to model
Added some include tflite folders
Changed c++ type to c++11 (in SES project build options)
Having two files both named kernel_util.cc seems to be causing some compile issues. Changed file settings in SES for second kernel_util.cc file to give it a different output name (kernel_util_2.obj).
In common.h (in C:\TensorFlow\tflite-micro\tensorflow\lite\kernels\internal), commented out lines 353 to 356 and 363, to get past error where it is looking for a built in function that does not seem to be present in the Segger compiler (or in the gcc compiler that SES is using).
